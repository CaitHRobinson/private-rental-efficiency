EPC data appended to Unique Property Reference Numbers - unique identifiers for every address - offer detailed insights into housing characteristics previously impossible to achieve using open-source data. Data is compiled for 3.9 million private rental properties (~78.8% of sector). Data is most complete for private rentals because a new certificate must be obtained every decade, unlike owner-occupied properties.

EPC include aggregate scores for efficiency and consumption, and physical attributes and efficiency characteristics. Efficiency ratings are estimated between A-G, with A being most efficient (Table 1). Our variables relate to the most intensive energy services â€“ space and water heating. Whilst most variables negatively impact efficiency (e.g., older properties often have inefficient solid walls), some are positive and negative.

We use EPC issued between September 2012 and September 2022 (ODC, 2022). We select only one EPC for each address. EPC property data is aggregated to Output Areas (OA) (n = 188,871) to overcome gaps in the dataset (ONS, 2022b.). OA contain between 40 and 250 households - as demographically close as possible to street-level. OA with less than five properties are removed (n = 151,890, ~80.4%).
