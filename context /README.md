## Contextualising clusters using social and demographic data

**Language:** Python 🐍

📌 **Section summary:** We [contextualise our clusters](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/private-rental-efficiency/blob/main/context%20/01_colating_data_for_clusters_copy.ipynb) with a range of social and demographic data available at Output Area from the most recent [Census in 2021](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census). In this section we show how to visualise data about deprivation, tenure, household size and age for OA in each cluster type.
